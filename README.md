# Artoo Adaptor For Arduino

This repository contains the Artoo (http://artoo.io/) adaptor and drivers for Arduino and Arduino-compatible microcontrollers (http://arduino.cc/) using the Firmata protocol (http://firmata.org).

Artoo is a open source micro-framework for robotics using Ruby.

For more information abut Artoo, check out our repo at https://github.com/hybridgroup/artoo

This gem makes extensive use of the hybridgroup fork of the firmata gem (https://github.com/hybridgroup/firmata) thanks to [@hardbap](https://github.com/hardbap) with code borrrowed from the arduino_firmata gem (https://github.com/shokai/arduino_firmata) thanks to [@shokai](https://github.com/shokai)

## Installing

```
gem install artoo-arduino
```

## Using

```ruby
require 'artoo'

connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '127.0.0.1:8023'
device :board
device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

work do
  puts "Firmware name #{board.firmware_name}"
  puts "Firmata version #{board.version}"
  every 1.second do
    led.toggle
  end
end
```

## Devices supported

The following hardware devices have driver support via the artoo-gpio gem:
- Button
- LED
- Maxbotix ultrasonic range finder
- Analog sensor
- Motor (DC)
- Servo

The following hardware devices have driver support via the artoo-i2c gem:

- Wiiclassic controller

## Connecting to Arduino

### OSX

The main steps are:
- Connect to the Arduino via serial port/USB
- Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
- Connect to the device via Artoo

First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port. A dialog box will appear telling you that a new network interface has been detected. Click "Network Preferences...", and when it opens, simply click "Apply".

Once plugged in, use the `artoo connect scan` command to find out your connection info:

```
$ artoo connect scan
```

Now you are ready to connect to the Arduino using a socket, such as in this example port 4567:

```
artoo connect serial ttyACM0
```

### Ubuntu

The main steps are:
- Connect to the Arduino via serial port/USB
- Use a socket to serial connection to map a TCP socket to the local unix port
- Connect to the device via Artoo

First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port.

Once plugged in, use the `ls /dev/ttyACM*` command to find out your connection info:

```
$ ls /dev/ttyACM*
/dev/ttyACM0
```

Now you are ready to connect to the Arduino using the socket, in this example port 4567:

```
artoo connect serial ttyACM0 4567
```
