# Artoo Adaptor For Arduino

This repository contains the Artoo (http://artoo.io/) adaptor and drivers for Arduino and Arduino-compatible microcontrollers (http://arduino.cc/) using the Firmata protocol (http://firmata.org).

Artoo is a open source micro-framework for robotics using Ruby.

For more information abut Artoo, check out our repo at https://github.com/hybridgroup/artoo

This gem makes extensive use of the hybridgroup fork of the firmata gem (https://github.com/hybridgroup/ruby-firmata) thanks to [@hardbap](https://github.com/hardbap) with code borrrowed from the arduino_firmata gem (https://github.com/shokai/arduino_firmata) thanks to [@shokai](https://github.com/shokai)

## Installing

```
gem install artoo-arduino
```

## Using

```ruby
require 'artoo'

connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0' #linux
device :board, :driver => :device_info
device :led, :driver => :led, :pin => 13

work do
  puts "Firmware name #{board.firmware_name}"
  puts "Firmata version #{board.version}"
  every 1.second do
    led.toggle
  end
end
```

## Devices supported

The following hardware devices have driver support via the artoo-gpio gem:
- Button
- LED
- Maxbotix ultrasonic range finder
- Analog sensor
- Motor (DC)
- Servo

The following hardware devices have driver support via the artoo-i2c gem:
- Wiichuck controller
- Wiiclassic controller

## Connecting to Arduino

### OSX / Linux

The main steps are:
- Install the artoo-arduino gem
- Find out what serial port your arduino is connected to
- Upload the Firmata protocol to the arduino
- Connect to the device via Artoo

First plug the Arduino into your computer via the USB/serial port. A dialog box will appear telling you that a new network interface has been detected. Click "Network Preferences...", and when it opens, simply click "Apply".

Install the artoo-arduino gem:

```
$ gem install artoo-arduino
```

Install the gort program from here: [![gort]](http://gort.io)

Once plugged in, use the gort to find out your connection info and serial port address:

```
$ gort scan serial
```

Use the `gort arduino install` command to install avrdude,
this will allow us to upload firmata to the arduino:

```
$ gort arduino install
```

Once the avrdude uploader is installed we upload the firmata protocol to
the arduino, use the arduino serial port address found when you ran `gort scan serial`, or leave it blank to use the default address `/dev/ttyACM0`.

Note: On a Mac you might need to use the `cu.` prefixed address instead of the `tty.` address.

```
$ gort arduino upload firmata /dev/ttyACM0
```

Change the example to use the correct serial port address

```
connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/ttyACM0' #linux
```

```
connection :arduino, :adaptor => :firmata, :port => '/dev/tty.usbmodem1411' #osx (might need cu. instead of tty.)
```

### Windows

We are currently working with the Celluloid team to add Windows support. Please check back soon!

## Contributing

* All active development is in the dev branch. New or updated features must be added to the dev branch. Hotfixes will be considered on the master branch in situations where it does not alter behaviour or features, only fixes a bug.
* All patches must be provided under the Apache 2.0 License
* Please use the -s option in git to "sign off" that the commit is your work and you are providing it under the Apache 2.0 License
* Submit a Github Pull Request to the appropriate branch and ideally discuss the changes with us in IRC.
* We will look at the patch, test it out, and give you feedback.
* Avoid doing minor whitespace changes, renamings, etc. along with merged content. These will be done by the maintainers from time to time but they can complicate merges and should be done seperately.
* Take care to maintain the existing coding style.
* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
* All pull requests should be "fast forward"
  * If there are commits after yours use “git rebase -i <new_head_branch>”
  * If you have local changes you may need to use “git stash”
  * For git help see [progit](http://git-scm.com/book) which is an awesome (and free) book on git
